## Usage
> [!WARNING]
> Not all terminals work perfectly with ANSI codes.
> Ideally you should use xterm-256color.

> [!NOTE]
> Terminal themes can change colors, e.g. magenta might show up as yellow, but it is still using the magenta ANSI code.

### Prerequisites
- Python version >=3.10
- A terminal emulator that accepts ANSI codes
- A terminal emulator that uses xterm-256color

> [!NOTE]
> ANSi codes are not limited to xterm-256color, but they may still be limited to all features this package provides.

#### Tested Terminals on Linux
Terminal ($TERM)
- Konsole (xterm-256color) - no missing features
- Xterm (xterm) - no missing features
- Alacritty (alacritty) - blinking text does not work
- Kitty (xterm-kitty) - blinking text does not work

### Colors
This package introduces the ability to print colors via name, id, and rgb with a single function:
```python
>>> from ansiplus import print_color
>>> print_color("my colored text", color=(100, 200, 255), bgcolor=198)
'my colored text'
>>> print_color("red text", color="red")
```

Colors may also be manually printed:
```python
>>> from ansiplus.ansi.colors import Fore
>>> print(f"{Fore.GREEN}green text{Fore.RESET}")
```

### User Input
Along with colors, users can be prompted for input which can be colored:
```python
>>> from ansiplus import input_color
>>> txt = input_color("example: ", color="blue")
>>> print(txt)
'my input'
```

Prompting input can also store history if you assign it to a variable:
```python
>>> from ansiplus import NewPrompt
>>> ui = NewPrompt()
>>> ui.set_color("red")
>>> ui.set_prompt_color("green")
>>> ui.prompt("prompt class example: ")
>>> ui.history
['my text']
>>> ui.latest
'my text'
>>> ui.prompt("prompt class example 2: ", "yellow")
>>> ui.latest
'this text is yellow, but default is red'
```

#### Clearing Prompt Lines
After receiving user input, the line can be cleared:
```python
from ansiplus import input_color
while True:
    input_color("forever input: ", clearline=True)
```
The above code sample will ask for input forever, after every input, the line will clear and the input will be prompted again on the same line.

### Text Styles
This package includes several several styles that can be used:
```python
>>> from ansiplus import print_style
>>> print_style("underline text", "underline")
'underline text'
```

Like colors, styles may also be used manually:
```python
>>> from ansiplus.ansi.styles import BOLD, BOLD_RESET
>>> print(f"{BOLD}bold text{BOLD_RESET}")
'bold text'
>>>
```

### More Functions
There are more ANSI codes featured beyond colors and styles, these could be viewed by using `help(ansiplus)` inside the python interpreter.
